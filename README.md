# Flutter Background Service - POC

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) for using background services in Flutter.

Background services are useful when performing tasks that require running in the background, such as updating an app's information, receiving notifications, and more, even when the app is not active on the device screen.

This POC project uses the flutter_background_service plugin to create a background service that updates the current time in the background. The application displays a value on the screen, and every 1 minute, the value is incremented in the background.

This project also includes an example of how to handle permissions, settings, and system resources to get the background service working properly.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in an editor of your choice (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code)
3. Run the project on your device or emulator
4. See the current time being updated in the background on the screen

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own background service projects in Flutter. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
